# Answer Guidelines: incident-management

## Must Cover
- Severity level definitions (SEV1 through SEV4) with response times, descriptions, and communication requirements (e.g., SEV1: < 5 minutes response, page on-call + exec notification)
- Escalation matrix defining incident command roles: Incident Commander (IC), Communications Lead, Subject Matter Expert (SME), and optionally Scribe, with clear responsibilities for each
- The incident response lifecycle: Detection -> Triage -> Mitigation -> Resolution, with emphasis on separating mitigation (stop the bleeding) from root cause analysis
- Communication templates for status page updates covering all four phases: Investigating, Identified, Monitoring, Resolved, with timestamp, impact description, current actions, and next update time
- Blameless postmortem format including: Summary, Impact (duration, users affected, revenue, SLO impact), Timeline (UTC), Root Cause Analysis with 5 Whys, Contributing Factors, What Went Well, What Went Poorly, and Action Items with owner/due date/status
- SLO and error budget framework with concrete examples (e.g., 99.95% availability = 21.6 minutes/month error budget) and error budget policy tiers (>50%, 25-50%, 10-25%, <10%)
- Mitigation decision tree: check recent deployment -> rollback or feature flag -> check dependency -> circuit breaker/fallback -> scale up/restart/failover
- Blameless postmortem ground rules: examine what happened not who is at fault, focus on systemic improvements, action items must have clear owners and deadlines

## Must NOT Do
- Foster blame culture -- postmortems must focus on systemic improvements, not individual fault; use "the system allowed X" instead of "person Y did X"
- Create postmortems without actionable follow-up items that have assigned owners and due dates
- Skip severity level definitions or treat all incidents with the same urgency
- Recommend manual-only runbooks without automation for common mitigations (rollback, circuit breakers, feature flags)

## Code Examples Must Include
- A severity level table or matrix defining SEV1-SEV4 with response time SLAs, impact descriptions, and communication channels
- A blameless postmortem template with sections for Summary, Impact, Timeline, Root Cause Analysis (including 5 Whys), Contributing Factors, What Went Well/Poorly, and Action Items table with Priority/Action/Owner/Due Date/Status columns
- Status page communication templates showing the four incident phases (Investigating, Identified, Monitoring, Resolved) with example update text
- An SLO definition in YAML format with `sli`, `objective`, `window`, and `error_budget` fields, plus an error budget policy with tiered responses based on remaining budget percentage
