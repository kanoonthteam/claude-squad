# Answer Guidelines: pipeline

## Must Cover

### Scenario 1: Phase Advance
- Recognize that ALL implementation tasks (T001, T002, T003) have status "done"
- State that the implementation phase is complete and the pipeline should advance
- Update pipelinePhase from "implementation" to "integration" in tasks.json
- Spawn the integration agent as the next step (not QA, not dev)
- Describe what the integration agent will do: write E2E tests, update docs (CHANGELOG, README), check cross-feature integration
- State that after integration completes, pipelinePhase advances to "verification" and QA agent is spawned

### Scenario 2: Context Recovery
- Read pipelinePhase from tasks.json to determine current state ("verification")
- Recognize it is in the verification phase without needing prior conversation context
- Spawn the QA agent to verify completed tasks against acceptance criteria
- Inform the user about the resumed state (e.g., "Resuming pipeline from verification phase")

### Scenario 3: Completion Exit
- Check pipelinePhase and find it is "completed"
- Stop orchestrating — do NOT treat this as a pipeline request
- Respond to the user's question normally (about dark mode toggle) as regular Claude
- Do NOT spawn any agents or create tasks.json entries for the new request unless the user invokes /pipeline

## Must NOT Do
- Must NOT skip the integration phase and go directly to QA/verification in Scenario 1
- Must NOT spawn more dev agents when all tasks are already "done" in Scenario 1
- Must NOT leave pipelinePhase as "implementation" when all tasks are complete in Scenario 1
- Must NOT ask the user what to do next in Scenario 1 — auto-advance is automatic
- Must NOT start a new pipeline or orchestrate agents in Scenario 3
- Must NOT say "I don't know where I am" or ask the user to explain state in Scenario 2 — pipelinePhase tells you
- Must NOT treat the dark mode request as a pipeline task in Scenario 3

## Code Examples Must Include
- A tasks.json snippet showing pipelinePhase updated to "integration" (Scenario 1)
- Reference to spawning the integration agent by name (Scenario 1)
- Reference to spawning the QA agent by name (Scenario 2)
