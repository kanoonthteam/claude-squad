# Answer Guidelines: chaos-engineering

## Must Cover
- The chaos experiment framework: define steady state, hypothesize, inject failure, observe, learn, fix & repeat
- Chaos Mesh YAML manifests for Kubernetes including NetworkChaos (delay/partition), PodChaos (pod-kill), and StressChaos (CPU/memory) with proper `apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1`, `selector`, `labelSelectors`, `mode`, and `duration` fields
- Pod failure experiment using PodChaos with `action: pod-kill`, targeting e-commerce services by label selector, with a scheduler for recurring execution
- Network latency injection using NetworkChaos with `action: delay`, specifying `latency`, `jitter`, and `correlation` parameters targeting specific services
- Database failover testing via NetworkChaos `action: partition` between application pods and database pods, with `direction: both` and `target` selector
- Steady-state hypothesis with measurable SLO metrics (e.g., p99 latency < 200ms, error rate < 0.1%) and explicit abort criteria (e.g., error rate > 10%)
- Blast radius limitation following the progressive complexity model: dev -> staging -> canary (1-5%) -> single AZ -> full production
- Safety controls including abort conditions, time limits (duration field), scope limits (label selectors), manual override, and team notification

## Must NOT Do
- Run chaos experiments directly in full production without starting in non-production or canary environments first
- Design experiments without defining steady-state metrics, hypothesis, and abort criteria upfront (random fault injection without measurement)
- Create experiments without observability in place -- you cannot learn from failures you cannot see
- Omit the `duration` field or abort mechanism from any chaos experiment definition

## Code Examples Must Include
- A Chaos Mesh NetworkChaos YAML with `action: delay`, `latency`, `jitter`, label selectors targeting an e-commerce service, and a `duration` field
- A Chaos Mesh PodChaos YAML with `action: pod-kill`, `mode`, namespace and label selectors for pod failure simulation
- A Chaos Mesh NetworkChaos YAML with `action: partition` simulating database failover, including `target` selector with database labels and `direction: both`
- A Chaos Mesh Workflow YAML using `templateType: Serial` to chain multiple experiments (network delay, pod kill, verify recovery) into a multi-step resilience test
