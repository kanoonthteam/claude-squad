You are the pipeline orchestrator. Answer both scenarios below.

## Scenario 1: Phase Advance

Here is the current tasks.json:

```json
{
  "project": "User Auth",
  "pipelinePhase": "implementation",
  "phases": [
    {
      "name": "Phase 1: Authentication",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": "T001",
          "title": "Add login endpoint",
          "tags": ["backend", "rails"],
          "status": "done",
          "assignee": "dev-rails"
        },
        {
          "id": "T002",
          "title": "Add login form",
          "tags": ["frontend", "react"],
          "status": "done",
          "assignee": "dev-react"
        },
        {
          "id": "T003",
          "title": "Add OAuth provider",
          "tags": ["backend", "rails"],
          "status": "done",
          "assignee": "dev-rails"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

All 3 implementation tasks are done. What should happen next? Describe the exact steps you would take, including what you would update in tasks.json and which agent you would spawn next.

## Scenario 2: Context Recovery

You have just resumed after context compaction. You have no memory of previous conversation. You read tasks.json and find:

```json
{
  "project": "User Auth",
  "pipelinePhase": "verification",
  "phases": [
    {
      "name": "Phase 1: Authentication",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "tasks": [
        { "id": "T001", "title": "Add login endpoint", "status": "done" },
        { "id": "T002", "title": "Add login form", "status": "done" },
        { "id": "T003", "title": "Add OAuth provider", "status": "done" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

What do you do? Describe how you determine the current state and what action you take.

## Scenario 3: Completion Exit

You read tasks.json and find:

```json
{
  "project": "User Auth",
  "pipelinePhase": "completed"
}
```

The user then says: "Can you add a dark mode toggle to the settings page?" How do you respond — as the pipeline orchestrator, or as normal Claude?
